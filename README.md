# RestaurantDemoApp 
This app is retrieves a set of restaurants from a json file and visualize them using a recycler view. One can sort the restaurant list based on it’s current openings state, you can favourite a restaurant and you can select a sort value to further sort the list. You can also search for restaurant word by word using a search bar provided.

Basic things considered while making this app:

1. Favourites: Favourite restaurants are at the top of the list, your current favourite restaurants are stored locally on the phone.
2. Openings state: Restaurant is either open (top), you can order ahead (middle) or a restaurant is currently closed (bottom).
3. Sort options: Always one sort option is chosen and this can be best match, newest, rating average, distance, popularity, average product price, delivery costs or the minimum cost.
4. Filtering: It’s up to you how you how you want to search by restaurant name.
